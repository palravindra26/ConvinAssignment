# Convin Assignment

The Django project can be found under ConvinSite directory.

I have implemented two views in views.py:

1) GoogleCalendarInitView()
    
    This view asks the user for his/her credentials.

2) GoogleCalendarRedirectView()

    This view lists 25 upcoming Google Calendar Events.
